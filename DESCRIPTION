Description: Generates/modifies RNA-seq data for use in simulations. We provide
    a suite of functions that will add a known amount of signal to a real 
    RNA-seq dataset. The advantage of using this approach over simulating under
    a theoretical distribution is that common/annoying aspects of the data
    are more preserved, giving a more realistic evaluation of your method. 
    The main functions are select_counts(), thin_diff(), thin_lib(), 
    thin_gene(), thin_2group(), thin_all(), and effective_cor(). See
    Gerard (2020) <doi:10.1186/s12859-020-3450-9> for details on the
    implemented methods.
